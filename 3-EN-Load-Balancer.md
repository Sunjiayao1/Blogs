SSL termination, also known as SSL offloading, is the process of decrypting SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport
Layer Security) encrypted traffic at a specific point in a network, such as at a load balancer or proxy server, rather
than at the destination server. This process offloads the CPU-intensive task of encrypting and decrypting traffic from
the application servers, potentially improving performance and simplifying certificate management.
